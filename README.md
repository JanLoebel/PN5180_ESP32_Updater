# PN5180 ESP32 Updater

This project can update the firmware of the PN5180 using a ESP32. 

## How to use
1. Set the `*_PIN` to the GPIO pins matching your connection to the PN5180.
2. Execute the script on your ESP32.
3. First the script will prompt you to enter any key to print current firmware information. If that does not work, please check the `*_PIN`-Settings.
4. After displaying the information you will be prompted again to enter any key to proceed with the firmware update itself.
5. At the end you will be prompted again to enter any key to print the firmware version information again to verify the new firmware is not on the PN5180.
